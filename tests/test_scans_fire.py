"""G2-meta-scans-reconciler — the meta-scan: every AST/grep-guard helper this
suite carries has been shown to catch something, by a test that *calls it*.

*A scan that has never fired has not been shown to check anything.* This
repo's guards over its own wiring (`tests/test_release_wiring.py`,
`tests/test_fleet_conventions.py`) each plant a violating tree beside the
real one; this file is that rule turned into a test that reads the *other*
test files: it finds every module-level helper in ``tests/`` that is shaped
like a violation-scanner and asserts that some planted-violation test in the
*same file* runs that helper — directly, or through another helper it calls.

This file is not a fresh design: it is homestead-ledger's
`tests/test_scans_fire.py` (itself a port of the sibling drift sweeps'
meta-scan), copied for its shape and re-grounded against this repo's own
test files. The discovery rule and the plant rule below are theirs, verified
here rather than re-derived, because a meta-scan that disagreed between
repos about what counts as "planted" would be exactly the kind of drift the
fleet's conventions exist to close. What changed in the port: the real files
it is held against are this repo's; the shared-module sweep takes the tests
directory as a parameter and is planted against a temporary one, because
this repo has no `tests/_scans.py` and a check that asserted one into
existence would be a check on the wrong repo.

**Discovery is structural, not a naming convention.** A rule that only
matched a leading underscore or a stem list would miss a public
`check_payload_reach(...)` (an AST-walking scan spelled the way a helper
meant to be imported is spelled) and a grep-shaped `forbidden_word_hits(path)`
that reads a file and asks `"payload" in text` with no `ast` and no matching
stem at all — both are planted below, alongside the real thing. So the rule
is what a scan *does*:

* it parses or walks source (`ast.parse`, `ast.walk`), **or**
* it matches text with a pattern (`re.search`/`findall`/`finditer`/`match`/
  `fullmatch`/`compile`, or a module-level compiled pattern's `.search(…)`),
  **or**
* it reads a file's text (`.read_text()`/`.read_bytes()`) *and* asks a
  membership question of it (`x in text`, `x not in parts`) — the grep shape
  with no regex in it, which `tests/test_fleet_conventions.py::_arms_automerge`
  is, **or**
* it walks a **module-level list of forbidden words** and asks membership of
  each — `[phrase for phrase in FORBIDDEN_PHRASES if phrase in checked]`. A
  scan of this shape reads no file (its caller hands it the text), compiles
  no pattern and parses no source, so none of the three rules above see it.
  The rule is narrow on purpose — the iteration must be over a module-level
  *collection* constant and the body must ask an `in` question — because
  "references a constant and says `in` somewhere" reports ordinary
  table-driven tests, and a meta-scan that cries wolf gets an allowlist
  bolted to it and stops meaning anything.

The name stems and the `_is_` prefix are kept on top of that, not instead of
it: they still catch helpers that hand their work to a caller. Discovery is a
union, so it is strictly wider than either half alone.

**Having a plant means a plant test calls the scan.** A test called
`test_the_guard_fires` that never touches the guard has not fired it — the
word in a test's name is not the evidence. A helper counts as planted only
when a `test_*` function whose name or docstring carries `plant`, `fires` or
`catches` reaches it — through the module's own helpers as well as directly,
so a plant that calls a wrapper has exercised the parser underneath it too.
Both halves are planted below: the name-only plant test (a counter-example
that must still be reported) and the call-through-a-helper case (which must
not).

**Honest about what it still cannot see.** A helper that reaches `ast.parse`
through an alias (`from ast import parse as p`), one that shells out to
`grep`, or one whose whole check is a comparison of two already-read strings
with no membership test and no pattern, is outside the rule above. Closing
those needs an interpreter, not a reader; this scan is the AST-grep half, not
a promise that it sees everything a scan could be shaped like. Scans written
inline in a test body rather than as a helper are the second half of this
file, with its own boundary stated there.

# test's own body, with nothing to name and nothing to plant, is invisible to
# it — `tests/test_hooks.py` asserted `MARKER in path.read_text()` three
# times before this bite factored the read into a helper. This half closes
# that gap: it walks every `test_*` function's own body for the same shapes
# the module-helper half already knows, holds it to the same "reads a file,
# not a string it built" requirement, and clears a test that delegates to a
# scan helper already defined (and already required to be planted) somewhere
# in `tests/` — recognized by name, whichever module actually owns it, since
# `from test_x import _helper` and a bare call to a same-file helper are the
# same delegation by a different route.
#
# "Reads a membership question of it" is held to the text actually read, not
# to anything built from it: a name bound directly to a `.read_text()`/
# `.read_bytes()` call (one level, no chain through `json.loads` or the
# like) counts; a dict key or a `Path.parents` check several steps removed
# does not. Loosening that would also catch `"x" in pyproject["project"]` and
# similar ordinary assertions that have nothing to do with scanning a tree,
# and a rule that cries wolf on those gets an allowlist bolted onto it and
# stops meaning anything, exactly the fate the module docstring above warns
# the word-list shape away from.


#: String operations that narrow text without turning it into something
#: else: `source.split("def main")[1]` is still the file's own text, and a
#: membership question of it is still a question of the tree. The list is
